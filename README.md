# Cooking_Helper_App
What to accomplish:
A user should be  able to add new recipes to his App.

When the user clicks on ‘add recipe', he should be able to add a new recipe on a separate page.

The user should be able to add a ‘recipe name', a place for the directions to make the recipe, and be able to add a list of ingredients.

The user should be able to check a checkbox to indicate whether or not he has the ingredient in stock.

If the user mistakenly adds an ingredient, he should be able to delete it.

Once back on the main page of the app, the user should be able to use the ‘Search' function to filter through his list of recipes.

Clicking on a recipe should allow the user to edit and then delete the recipe, if necessary.

On the home page, there should be a summary statement for each recipe that indicates whether the user has ‘none', ‘some', or ‘all' of the ingredients.
